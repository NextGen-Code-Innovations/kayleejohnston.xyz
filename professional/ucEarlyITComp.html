    <h1>UC Early IT Competition</h1>
    <p>In this competition we were tasked with making a user interface for a company to use to track their sales on certain goods and services. Unfortunately due to a disruptive classmate who broke the computer I was using this never got submitted, although I did talk to the competiton leader and I would have placed Second overall if it was submitted on time.</p>
    <h3>What Did I Choose and Why?</h3>
    <p>At the time of this competiton I was diving into Python heavily for the first time. When i first attempted this competition I quickly realized that I did not have the knowlede or skill set built yet to be able to do my complex idea. In the future I may re design this as a test of my skills and possibly give it a GUI as opposed to only a CLI interface and refine the details on how data is stored and implement a SQL Database.</p>
