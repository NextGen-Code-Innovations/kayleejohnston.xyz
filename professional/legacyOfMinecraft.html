    <h1>My Minecraft Story</h1>
    <p>In early 2016 I got Minecraft for the first time on my PS4, I would play for a few months and then leave the game for a couple years. When I come back onto Java Edition this time there is a whole new world and I started messign around with making servers.</p>

    <h3>Servers:</h3>
    <p>Minecraft servers have always been my main form of gameplay since I rejoined the game. I have messed around with hosting my own servers at my house about could never get one to be public as my ISP doesn't not allow port forwarding and ended up getting discouraged for a few months. While I was making and running servers I started messing around with modding it. Getting started was a rough start but whenever I can't figure something out I always turn to someone who knows more than me for advice after I look through forms for whatever the task I am trying to do may be. After a while I come back and am trying to start my own server using Amazon Web Services as a host to streamline things and make it easier to manage server errors.</p>
